So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest", which you must attend if possible. </p>

                    Bottom Line: The film will bring back the magic for your t(w)een, who was a fan of the original. But, it could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in the full review. Full Review: While it had some great songs, and I thought better instrumental music, I still like the music from the original better. The reprise of "Into the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by Panic! At the Disco - clearly meant to appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.

                    The Lion King', a faithful remake of the 1994 original, has a high-profile cast and some truly spectacular visuals working for it. The story is the same; the young lion cub Simba’s life changes forever after his father is murdered. The plotline, however, is also the film’s main problem. Fans who have seen the original would know exactly how the film will progress, down to every scene and every line. The lack of any major surprise element or creativity is where the film loses out.

                            Rick Riordan has managed to attract many young readers with his engrossing and fast-paced books. I think that his unique selling point is the fact that he merges the modern world with the world of Greek mythology. Greek mythology by itself can be very dull, but by relating the story to modern times, the audience easily connects to the story, and readers start loving his books.

                            In ‘Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief’, the first book of the series, Riordan introduces us to Percy Jackson, the main character of the series.

                            Percy Jackson is a demigod, but he doesn’t know that in the beginning. As the story moves forward, he finds out about the crazy world of Greek gods and monsters, and goes to a “camp”, a safe haven for demigods, where they spend their time training and learning how to survive in this monster-infested world.

                            Riordan has given all the gods a personality that matches the modern world. Poseidon spends his free time wearing shorts and sunglasses at the beach, sipping pina colada. Aphrodite loves to look beautiful and applies the best makeup she can find.

                            After we are introduced to a few gods and demigods, the plot thickens. Percy is accused of stealing Lord Zeus’s divine thunderbolt, a special weapon that had been made for the King of the gods themselves. So, Percy, along with his new friends, goes on a perilous quest, fighting monsters, and eventually finding out who the real thief was.

                            The book is unlike anything I have read. The amazing thing is that children of all age groups can enjoy his books.

                            After you finish the Percy Jackson series, his other interconnecting books make this fantastic world even more interesting. Bits and pieces join together, making the end really marvellous. I would highly recommend all his books. They are a must read. It’s good stuff.<br> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.in/Percy-Jackson-Lightning-Thief-Book/dp/0141346809/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1RJV9TLK9YXAV&dchild=1&keywords=percy+jackson+book+1&qid=1603451150&sprefix=percy+%2Caps%2C1079&sr=8-3"><b>BEST BUY LINK</b></a> </p>

                        <p class="p_modal">After loving my reread of the first book in the series it is time to jump straight into the second in the series.

The heroic son of Poseidon makes an action-packed comeback in the second must-read installment of Rick Riordan’s amazing young readers series. Starring Percy Jackson, a “half blood” whose mother is human and whose father is the God of the Sea, Riordan’s series combines cliffhanger adventure and Greek mythology lessons that results in true page-turners that get better with each installment.

In this episode, The Sea of Monsters, Percy sets out to retrieve the Golden Fleece before his summer camp is destroyed, surpassing the first book’s drama and setting the stage for more thrills to come.

Taken from goodreads

 Percy is told that he shouldnt come to camp this summer as he will be in danger, but obviously in traditional Percy style, he goes anyway. This is when you find out the extent of what Percy is willing to do for his friends.and if anything after reading this book you will end up liking Percy even more. 

Compared to the action scenes in the last book this one is leaps and bounds above. We get boat battles, and battles against giants and Percy is able to hold his better this time around. Now when you are reading the fight scenes you now have a feeling Percy might just win every fight instead of just hoping he isnt going to get killed. 

The book is very short at just 265 pages, which is more than a 100 less than the first book. This does make everything happen in a very short amount of time but this is actually a good thing. When you are on a quest and have a time limit then you don’t want any filler to make the days go slower you want everything and fast as possible.

This is when Percy and Annabeth start becoming closer together and can see that something is close to starting between them, I am looking forward to reading about their journey together.

This is a great way to continue the series and I have already started the next book.<br> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.in/Percy-Jackson-Monsters-Rick-Riordan/dp/0141346841/ref=sr_1_3?crid=24F3Q55AIOI0E&dchild=1&keywords=percy+jackson+sea+of+monsters+book&qid=1603787699&sprefix=percy+jackson+sea%2Caps%2C303&sr=8-3"><b>BEST BUY LINK</b></a> </p>

                        <p class="p_modal">Onto the third book in the series and I am remembering why I love this series so much, so let’s see how this book pans out.

It’s not everyday you find yourself in combat with a half-lion, half-human.

But when you’re the son of a Greek god, it happens. And now my friend Annabeth is missing, a goddess is in chains and only five half-blood heroes can join the quest to defeat the doomsday monster.

Oh, and guess what? The Oracle has predicted that not all of us will survive…

So while on a recruitment mission things start to go very wrong for Percy, the monster who is trying to take the kids gets away but not only that he takes Annabeth with him. At the same time the God artemis has been kidnapped and is hidden somewhere on the west side of America. This means a quest is in place to find Artemis in time for her to be on the council for the winter solstice. Percy is not chosen to go on the quest but he sneaks away anyway as he needs to find Annabeth. I remember when I first read this book that this was when I realised just how much I wanted Annabeth and Percy to be together, Percy was willing to travel the whole of the country and risk being killed in order to get his friends back.

You also get to see that Percy himself starts to notice he has feelings for Annabeth, yes it does take the god of love to basically have to tell him in order to do so but it is still progression. I feel bad for Percy during this book quite a lot, his friendship with Thiala is strained due to them both being children of the big three but Thiala is older so more like to be the child of the prophecy, but also because they are both very similar people. Not only that but because he is a boy, the leader of the quest Zoë is a hunters of Artemis hates him and at every single point tries to put him down.

Nico is a character I am actually interested in and it is going to be nice to reread his story, as I think except for the main three (Annabeth, Groover and Percy) he is my favourite character. This is because at a young age he has lost so much and has just as much potential as Percy does, but will his built up hatred make him make bad decisions? Well we will have to read to carry on.

The fighting scenes are starting to get better as Percy is getting more training and is learning how to fight properly, but we finally get to see the punishment that Ares promised from the first book coming back to bite Percy, which causes him to have to think on his fight when he is not able to fight.

The writing is great as it makes you just want to sit and read the book all in one sitting. This is what I have come to expect from Rick Riordan and it is great that even his early books are able to still do this. This is a great instalment in the series and I cant wait to get into the fourth book.<br> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.in/Percy-Jackson-Titans-Curse-Riordan/dp/0141346817/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3HPTZAT2CND89&dchild=1&keywords=percy+jackson+titans+curse&qid=1603787531&sprefix=titan+percy+jackson%2Caps%2C363&sr=8-3"><b>BEST BUY LINK</b></a> </p>

Percy Jackson isn’t expecting freshman orientation to be any fun. But when a mysterious mortal acquaintance appears at his potential new school, followed by demon cheerleaders, things quickly move from bad to worse.

In this fourth installment of the blockbuster series, time is running out as war between the Olympians and the evil Titan lord Kronos draws near. Even the safe haven of Camp Half-Blood grows more vulnerable by the minute as Kronos’s army prepares to invade its once impenetrable borders. To stop the invasion, Percy and his demigod friends must set out on a quest through the Labyrinth – a sprawling underground world with stunning surprises at every turn.

Taken from goodreads

You are thrown straight into the action with this book as within the first chapter Percy is already on the run from the police, which for me makes for a great pace for the rest of the book. Luckily in this action packed book it basically does have the same pace throughout.

I read this book in a single day which is something I have not done since I was about 15, this just shows how action packed it is. Even when there isn’t any fighting happening then there is development in the characters which is just something you don’t want to miss, especially with the relationship between Percy and Annabeth starting to arise, but at the same time every time it does then something brings it back down.

I said in my review of the Titans Curse that Nico is a character I am very much interested in as he seems to be different to all the other characters due to just how dark he is, mainly due to his father. In this book we get to see a lot more of him and see how he is coping with the grieving of him losing his sister, not only that but we get to see what he actually thinks of Percy. Whenever he is involved it just makes everything seem darker in the book, which is weird to think about especially as he is only 11 years old.

This is a great installment into the series and does a great job of being the penultimate book of the series as due to the ending then all you want to do is jump straight into the final book and find out what is going to happen to the Half Bloods and see if they are going to survive. With great pacing and fantastic writing, and decent character progression this series just seems to be getting better and better each book.<br> <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.in/Percy-Jackson-Battle-Labyrinth-Book/dp/0141346833/ref=sr_1_2?crid=WIS1N24FK6CH&dchild=1&keywords=percy+jackson+and+the+battle+of+the+labyrinth+book+4&qid=1603787769&sprefix=percy+jackson+battle+of+the++book%2Caps%2C320&sr=8-2"><b>BEST BUY LINK</b></a> </p>
